## Version 1.0.4

This version focuses on significant performance improvements and enhanced user experience for the restore command.

### Improved

- **Restore Command Performance**: Optimized the restore process for faster execution:
    - Removed redundant database connection testing during restore startup
    - Eliminated duplicate dump file verification (now verified once and reused)
    - Optimized dump file verification to check SQL extensions first before spawning pg_restore process
    - Improved database recreation process with better error handling for transaction block limitations

- **Real-time Progress Feedback**: Enhanced restore operations with live progress indicators:
    - Added real-time streaming of pg_restore output during database restoration
    - Implemented detailed progress logging for database preparation steps (terminate connections, drop, create)
    - Added verbose mode by default for pg_restore operations to show table creation, data insertion, and index building progress
    - Improved user feedback with "This may take a while for large databases..." messages

### Fixed

- **Database Recreation Error**: Fixed PostgreSQL transaction block error when dropping and recreating databases by separating DDL commands into individual operations
- **Silent Restore Operations**: Resolved issue where large restore operations appeared to hang with no progress indication

### Changed

- **Default Verbosity**: Restore operations now run in verbose mode by default to provide better user feedback
- **Progress Streaming**: All pg_restore and psql operations now stream output in real-time instead of buffering until completion
- **Error Context**: Improved error messages with more specific context about which operation failed

### Technical

- Added `executeCommandWithProgress()` function for real-time command output streaming
- Optimized `verifyDumpFile()` to use fast-path detection for SQL files
- Refactored `dropAndRecreateDatabase()` to handle PostgreSQL DDL transaction limitations
- Enhanced restore command flow to reduce unnecessary database connections and operations
