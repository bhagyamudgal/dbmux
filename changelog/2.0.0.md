## Version 2.0.0 - Major Runtime Migration & URL Connection Support

This is a significant release that introduces database URL connection support and migrates the entire project from Node.js + pnpm to Bun runtime for improved performance, faster builds, and better development experience. The release also includes automated binary distribution and enhanced CI/CD workflows.

### New

- **Database URL Connection Support**: Added ability to connect using database URLs in addition to individual connection fields:
    - Command line support: `dbmux connect --url "postgresql://user:password@host:port/database"`
    - Interactive mode now offers choice between URL or individual fields
    - Supports PostgreSQL URLs: `postgresql://` or `postgres://`
    - Supports SQLite URLs: `sqlite:///path/to/database.db`
    - SSL parameter support: `?ssl=true` or `?sslmode=require`

- **Enhanced Connection Options**:
    - Added `-U` or `--url` flag to connect command
    - URL parsing with validation and error handling
    - Automatic fallback to driver defaults for missing URL components

### Improved

- **Connection Workflow**: Users can now choose their preferred connection method:
    - Direct URL: `dbmux connect --url "postgres://user:pass@localhost/db"`
    - Interactive URL entry with real-time validation
    - Traditional individual fields (host, port, user, etc.)

- **User Experience**: Streamlined connection process with fewer required steps when using complete database URLs

### Runtime Migration

- **Bun Runtime Migration**: Migrated entire project from Node.js + pnpm to Bun runtime for improved performance and development experience:
    - Replaced pnpm with Bun as package manager for faster installs and builds
    - Native TypeScript support without transpilation
    - Unified toolchain (runtime + package manager + bundler)
    - Faster startup times and better performance

- **Build & Distribution Enhancements**:
    - Added cross-platform binary compilation with Bun
    - New build scripts: `bun build:linux`, `bun build:macos-arm`, `bun build:windows`
    - GitHub Actions automated binary releases for Linux, macOS (Intel/ARM), and Windows
    - Automated npm publishing in release workflow

### Development & Testing

- **Enhanced Testing Infrastructure**:
    - Added comprehensive test coverage for URL connection features (106 tests passing)
    - New test files: `tests/connect.test.ts`, `tests/prompt.test.ts`
    - Maintained Vitest for testing (for vi.hoisted() compatibility)
    - Added URL parsing validation tests with edge cases

- **Release Automation**:
    - Added `release.sh` script with safety checks for uncommitted changes
    - Integrated release script as `bun run release` command
    - Automated version bumping, binary building, and git tagging
    - GitHub Actions workflow for cross-platform binary releases

### Configuration & Documentation

- **Updated Development Workflow**:
    - All scripts migrated to Bun: `bun dev`, `bun build`, `bun run test`
    - Updated CI/CD pipeline to use Bun instead of pnpm
    - Modified git hooks to use `bunx lint-staged`
    - Cleaned up obsolete pnpm files and references

- **Documentation Updates**:
    - Updated README.md with URL connection examples and Bun commands
    - Enhanced CLAUDE.md with Bun migration details and new architecture overview
    - Added comprehensive GitHub secrets setup guide for automated releases
    - Updated all command references throughout documentation

### Technical

- Added URL parsing functionality with support for multiple database URL formats
- Enhanced connection configuration logic to handle both URL and field-based inputs
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing connection methods
- Added TypeScript strict mode compliance for URL parsing
- Binary execution detection for Bun compiled binaries (`/$bunfs/root/` path handling)
- Cross-platform compatibility maintained while leveraging Bun-specific optimizations
