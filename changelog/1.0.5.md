## Version 1.0.5

This version introduces database URL connection support for easier and more flexible connection management.

### New

- **Database URL Connection Support**: Added ability to connect using database URLs in addition to individual connection fields:
    - Command line support: `dbmux connect --url "postgresql://user:password@host:port/database"`
    - Interactive mode now offers choice between URL or individual fields
    - Supports PostgreSQL URLs: `postgresql://` or `postgres://`
    - Supports SQLite URLs: `sqlite:///path/to/database.db`
    - SSL parameter support: `?ssl=true` or `?sslmode=require`

- **Enhanced Connection Options**:
    - Added `-U` or `--url` flag to connect command
    - URL parsing with validation and error handling
    - Automatic fallback to driver defaults for missing URL components

### Improved

- **Connection Workflow**: Users can now choose their preferred connection method:
    - Direct URL: `dbmux connect --url "postgres://user:pass@localhost/db"`
    - Interactive URL entry with real-time validation
    - Traditional individual fields (host, port, user, etc.)

- **User Experience**: Streamlined connection process with fewer required steps when using complete database URLs

### Technical

- Added URL parsing functionality with support for multiple database URL formats
- Enhanced connection configuration logic to handle both URL and field-based inputs
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing connection methods
- Added TypeScript strict mode compliance for URL parsing
